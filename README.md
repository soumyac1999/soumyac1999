### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Soumya, a Masters student at Stanford studying Computer Science. Previously, I was at Google Research and had received my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay.

My research interests broadly lie in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am currently excited about knowledge augmented methods and question answering. I am also interested in ML systems.
