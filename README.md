### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Soumya Chatterjee, masters student at Stanford University studying Computer Science. Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Reasercher at Google Research India. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay.

My research interests broadly lie in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am currently excited about knowledge augmented methods, question answering and symbolic reasoning.
